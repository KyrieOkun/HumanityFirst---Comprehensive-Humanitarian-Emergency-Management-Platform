HumanityFirst - Emergency Management Platform
============================================

**A personal humanitarian technology initiative by White Nash**

HumanityFirst is a comprehensive Emergency Development Environment designed for humanitarian disaster response and emergency management. This platform represents a dedicated effort to provide accessible, life-saving technology for organizations serving communities in crisis.

Developed as a purely charitable initiative, HumanityFirst addresses critical coordination challenges during emergencies through volunteer-driven, open-source development focused on real humanitarian needs rather than commercial interests.

Built on the **web2py** web application framework and written in **Python** (version 3.9+), HumanityFirst utilizes *HTML5*, *JavaScript*, and *SCSS* for web content generation, plus *XSLT* for specialized data format handling.

This documentation serves application developers and is maintained alongside the source code as part of the humanitarian mission to ensure accessible emergency management technology.
